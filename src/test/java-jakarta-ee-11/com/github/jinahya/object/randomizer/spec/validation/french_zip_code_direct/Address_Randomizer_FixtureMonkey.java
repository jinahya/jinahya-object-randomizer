 * A Fixture Monkey randomizer of {@link Address}.

 * Nothing is overridden here, and that is what this package shows. Fixture Monkey reads both constraints off the field
 * and generates a value which satisfies them, so this flavor needs no help at all -- while the same engine, in the
 * {@code french_zip_code} package beside this one, refuses outright to sample the very same requirement wrapped in a
 * composed constraint.
